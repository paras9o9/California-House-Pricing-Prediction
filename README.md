# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction using Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regression

This project predicts median house values in California using multiple regression techniques, emphasizing the complete ML workflow — from raw data to model deployment. It includes comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview

I used the **California Housing Prices dataset** to build and evaluate three machine learning models:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression** (with alpha tuning via cross-validation)
- **Random Forest Regressor** (with hyperparameter tuning via `RandomizedSearchCV`)

### 🔍 Key Insights:

- **Linear Regression** captured general trends  
  👉 Test R²: **0.57**
- **Lasso Regression** improved generalization  
  👉 Test R²: **0.60**
- **Random Forest Regressor** gave the best performance  
  👉 Test R²: **0.83**

### 📈 Most Influential Features:

- `median_income`
- `ocean_proximity_INLAND`
- `population_per_households`
- `latitude` & `longitude`

Residual analysis confirmed good model fit with minimal bias and acceptable variance.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Model               | Test R² | Test MSE |
|--------------------|---------|----------|
| Linear Regression   | 0.5747  | 0.1391   |
| Lasso Regression    | 0.5991  | 0.1311   |
| Random Forest       | 0.8377  | 0.0531   |

## 💡 Key Features

- **Log transformation** and **feature scaling** to improve model performance
- **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variable (`ocean_proximity`)
- Custom feature engineering:  
  `room_per_households`, `bedroom_per_room`, `population_per_households`
- Residual plots and feature importance visualizations

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Lasso helped reduce overfitting by penalizing less important features.
- Ensemble methods like Random Forest captured non-linear relationships effectively.
- Preprocessing (especially handling skew and scale) significantly improved performance.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add a **Streamlit web interface** for real-time predictions.
- Integrate **map-based visualizations** for geospatial insight.
- Compare performance with **Gradient Boosting** or **XGBoost**.
